# Create a Pull Request

## When to use this skill

Use this skill when:

- You are ready to submit code changes for review
- The user asks you to create a PR, open a PR, or submit changes
- You have finished implementing a feature, fix, or chore

## Pre-flight checks

Before creating a branch or pushing any code, run all of the following checks and fix any failures:

1. **Format**: `npm run format-check` — if it fails, run `npm run format` and stage the changes
2. **Build & type check**: `npm run build` — this runs `tsc --noEmit` then esbuild; fix any type errors
3. **Tests**: `npm test` — all tests must pass with no warnings or unexpected console output

Do NOT skip these steps. Do NOT push code that fails any of these checks.

## Documentation requirements

Every PR that changes user-facing behavior **must** include documentation updates in the same commit or PR:

- **Feature additions**: Update `README.md` and create or update relevant guides in `docs/`
- **Feature changes**: Update all affected documentation files in `docs/`
- **Settings changes**: Update `docs/reference/settings.md` and `docs/reference/advanced-settings.md`
- **Feature removal**: Remove or rewrite documentation for removed features

If the change is purely internal (test cleanup, refactoring with no behavior change, CI/tooling), documentation updates are not required — but check the "Documentation has been updated" box as N/A.

## PR template

This repository has a PR template at `.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md`. You **must** use it. The PR body must include all of the following sections:

### Summary

A concise description of what the PR does and why. Link to the related issue with `Fixes #<number>` if applicable.

### Changes

A bullet list of key changes.

### Screenshots / Screencast

Required for UI changes. Delete this section only if the change is purely backend/internal.

### Checklist

Complete every item in the checklist. Use `[x]` for items that are done and `[ ]` for items that are not applicable (add a note explaining why):

### Title conventions

- Keep under 70 characters
- Use conventional commit prefixes: `feat:`, `fix:`, `chore:`, `docs:`, `refactor:`, `test:`
- Use imperative mood: "Add feature" not "Added feature"

## After creating the PR

- Return the PR URL to the user
- Monitor for CodeRabbit review comments and address them
